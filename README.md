## Overview

**Enhanced Robot Pathfinding Simulation** is a Java Swing application that demonstrates a grid-based robot pathfinding algorithm. It allows users to create obstacles, visualize the robot's movement, and customize themes.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Grid:** Click on the grid to add or remove obstacles dynamically.
- **Pathfinding Algorithm:** Uses a priority queue-based shortest path algorithm.
- **Dynamic Controls:** Start, reset, pause/resume, and switch themes.
- **Adjustable Speed:** Use the slider to change the robot's movement speed accordingly.
- **Custom Themes:** Switch between `Default`, `Space`, and `Jungle` themes.
- **Score Tracking:** Tracks the robot's progress with a score system.
